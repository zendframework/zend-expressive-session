This library provides session handling middleware for PSR-7 applications, using
an adapter-based approach that will allow usage of ext-session, JWT, or other
approaches.

## Installation

Run the following to install this library:

```bash
$ composer require zendframework/zend-expressive-session
```

However, the package is not immediately useful unless you have a persistence
adapter. If you are okay with using ext-session, you can install the following
package as well:

```bash
$ composer require zendframework/zend-expressive-session-ext
```
